# Analysis-of-American-Flights-in-2020
I analyzed American flights during the year 2020. This analysis allowed me to answer a few questions I had such as: - What percentage of flights has been cancelled? - Which Airline has had the most flight? - How many primary airports? - Number of Airlines? - Which airport has the most departing flights? least departing flights? - What Percentage of all flights depart from or arrive at Atlanta International Airport? - Number of Flights diverted? - What is the relationship between states based on Arrival and Departure?
